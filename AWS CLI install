Installed and configured the AWS CLI on a Red Hat Linux instance because this instance type does not have the AWS CLI pre-installed. Some instance types, such as Amazon Linux, do come pre-installed with the AWS CLI. 

I established a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the instance and configured the installation with an access key that can connect to an AWS account. Finally, I practiced using the AWS CLI to interact with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

1.downloaded file to the current directory using:
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"

2.Unziped the installer using:
unzip -u awscliv2.zip

3.Installed AWS CLI using install script:
sudo ./aws/install

4.Configured the AWS CLI:
aws configure 
and provided the values for the prompts.

5.Tested some CLI commands like:
aws iam list-users
aws iam list-policies --scope Local
aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn ...
